# Fullstack Application with Authentication using Node.js, Next.js, and Clerk
This repository contains a fullstack application that demonstrates how to implement authentication using Node.js, Next.js, and Clerk. Clerk is a powerful authentication and identity management tool that simplifies the process of adding secure user authentication to your applications.

Technologies Used
Node.js: The backend of the application is built using Node.js, which allows for efficient server-side processing.

Next.js (app folder): The frontend of the application is developed using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and optimized client-side navigation.

Clerk: Clerk is utilized to implement authentication features easily. It provides pre-built components and a backend infrastructure to handle user authentication and identity management securely.

Getting Started
To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

> git clone https://github.com/Henrique-Moreno/auth-clerk-server.git
Navigate to the App Folder: Move to the "app" folder, where the frontend of the application is located:

cd your-repo/app
Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

npm install
yarn install
Configure Clerk:

Create an account on Clerk if you haven't already.
Set up your Clerk application and note down your API keys and other necessary configuration details.
Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file in the "app" folder and add the following environment variables:

npm run dev
yarn dev
Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the running application.

Usage
The application demonstrates how to implement user registration, login, and logout using Clerk's pre-built components and backend services.

Explore the codebase to understand how the integration between the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js) works to provide a seamless authentication experience.
